# SudokuSolver-Python

A Sudoku Solver in Python.

## Algorithm

To solve even the most challenging of these puzzles, our Sudoku solver only needs to follow three strategies:

1. If a square has only one candidate, place that value there.
2. If a candidate is unique within a row, box or column, place that value there (hidden singles).
3. If neither 1 or 2 is true in the entire grid, make a guess. Backtrack if the Sudoku becomes unsolvable.

The Sudoku Solver also implements other strategies. These can make the code run marginally faster

- Hidden/naked pairs
- Hidden/naked triples
- Pointing pairs
- Box-line reduction (not working).

See [www.SudokuWiki.org][sudokuwiki] for more information on strategies.

## Input files.

A Sudoku in grid form:  
 [8, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0]  
 [6, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0]  
 [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  
 [0, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0]  
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 4, 3, 0]  
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  
 [0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]  
 [9, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  
 [5, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

It can be serialised by concatenating rows instead of stacking them:

> 890070010620003050004000000060040200000085430000100000002700500900200100500400000

This is more space efficient for storing multiple Sudokus.

The code has functionality to read in serialised Sudokus and convert them to a grid.
